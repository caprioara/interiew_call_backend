# interiew_call_backend
Create a new django project that has 1 backend page. It should contain an email, name and password input fields and store that data into a database upon submitting the data. You can use the same page or another to retrieve and display the users from the database. We are mostly focused on functionality so donâ€™t worry about the aesthetics of the page.
